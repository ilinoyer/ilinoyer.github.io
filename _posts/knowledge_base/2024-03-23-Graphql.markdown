In my previous company, I had a chance to work with GraphQL.
We used this technology a bit non-standard, which required us to create new tools. 
One requirement we struggled with a lot was that the GraphQL scheme could change at runtime of the system. 
I think it was one of the biggest challenges in my "career" so far. In this post, I would like to share with you some resources that I found useful at the time.
